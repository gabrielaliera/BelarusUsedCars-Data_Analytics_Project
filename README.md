# Project Information
Our project is based on a dataset of a 2019 online catalog for used cars market in Belarus (eastern Europe). The dataset contains data that was parsed from car ads in an online catalog. This dataset is useful for both the buyer and the seller in the used car market in Belerus. We got our dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/lepchenkov/usedcarscatalog">Kaggle</a>.

2. In this region, which car brands and models have the highest listing in the catalog?
3. Which body type and color has the highest listing?
4. Which transmission, fuel type, and drive-wheel has the highest listing?
5. What are the average prices per body type?
6. What is the range of the price and the age of the cars listed?
7. Is there a correlation between the age of car and price?
8. Do expensive cars have more number of photos?
9. Does having more photos lead to more views?
10. If the number of views increase, do the number of days listed decrease?
11. Is there a relationship between the type of transmission and the price of the car?
12. Are the diesel car prices significantly higher or lower than the gasoline car prices?
13. Are transmission and fuel types independent or dependent?
